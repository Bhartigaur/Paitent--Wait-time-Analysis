Patient Wait Time Analysis Dashboard
Overview
This repository contains a Power BI-based solution for analyzing patient wait times in healthcare facilities. The goal is to help healthcare administrators and staff identify bottlenecks, optimize patient flow, and improve the overall patient experience by reducing wait times.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to use Power BI to analyze patient wait time data and visualize insights that can drive operational improvements. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of patient wait times from various perspectives, such as:

Average Wait Time: Track the average time patients spend in the waiting room before being seen by healthcare providers.
Wait Time by Department: Analyze wait times across different hospital departments, such as emergency, outpatient, and specialty clinics.
Time of Day/Day of Week Analysis: Identify trends in wait times by time of day or day of the week to optimize staffing and resource allocation.
Patient Demographics: Understand how wait times vary based on factors like age, gender, and medical condition.
Provider Efficiency: Measure the performance of healthcare providers in terms of patient throughput and time spent per patient.
